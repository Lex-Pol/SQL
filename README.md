# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written while completing Charlotte Chaze's *Break Into Tech Data Analytics Certificate Course*. Please feel free to review the work that I have done, thus far.

I welcome questions, constructive criticism and praises! :)

# Alexis' Background

My name is Alexis and I am new to the tech and data analytics world! I have an extensive background in the legal field as a litigation paralegal, but have reached the pique of my career and interest. I want to challenge myself with a new career path: data analytics!
I have always enjoyed working with numbers and thinking outside the box using my creativity. I hope my SQL Portfolio showcases that even though I may be a novice, I am fully capable of understanding the work and executing it properly and satisfactorily.
